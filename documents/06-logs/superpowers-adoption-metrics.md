# Superpowers Adoption Metrics

**Tracking Period:** 2026-03-13 (Week 1) → 2026-05-08 (Week 8)
**Purpose:** Measure impact of Superpowers-inspired skills on development efficiency
**Reference:** `documents/03-planning/superpowers-integration-implementation-plan.md`

---

## Baseline Metrics (Week 0 - Before Superpowers)

**Date Collected:** 2026-03-13
**Data Source:** Git history, JaCoCo reports, GitHub Issues

### 1. Development Velocity

**PR Merge Time (Last 10 PRs):**

| PR # | Title | Created | Merged | Duration | Iterations |
|------|-------|---------|--------|----------|------------|
| #74 | Reorganize markdown files | 2026-03-13 | 2026-03-13 | ~1 hour | 1 |
| #73 | Update versions and fix links | 2026-03-13 | 2026-03-13 | ~1 hour | 1 |
| #72 | Fix Docker workflow status | 2026-03-13 | 2026-03-13 | ~2 hours | 1 |
| #71 | Fix CI deprecated actions | 2026-03-13 | 2026-03-13 | ~1 hour | 1 |
| #70 | (Superpowers research commits) | 2026-03-13 | - | - | - |
| #69-65 | (Previous PRs - need to check git history) | - | - | - | - |

**Average PR Time:** ~1.25 hours (4 PRs)
**Average Iterations:** 1.0 (no rework needed - simple maintenance tasks)

**Note:** Recent PRs (71-74) were simple maintenance tasks. Need more complex feature PRs for accurate baseline.

### 2. Test Coverage

**Backend (kiteclass-core):**
```
Coverage: 229/229 tests passing (100% pass rate)
Line Coverage: ~75-80% (estimated from recent reports)
Branch Coverage: ~70% (estimated)
```

**Backend (kiteclass-gateway):**
```
Coverage: Gateway tests passing
Line Coverage: ~70-75% (estimated)
Branch Coverage: ~65% (estimated)
```

**Frontend (kiteclass-frontend):**
```
Coverage: Not yet measured (no test suite established)
Target: Establish baseline in Week 1-2
```

**Overall Target:** 85% line coverage (up from 75% baseline)

### 3. Bug Escape Rate

**Recent Bugs (Last 30 days):**

| Issue # | Type | Severity | Escaped to | Time to Fix | Root Cause |
|---------|------|----------|------------|-------------|------------|
| - | Redis serialization error | MEDIUM | Manual testing | ~2 hours | Missing @JsonTypeInfo on DTOs |
| - | findById() bypasses filter | HIGH | Unit testing | ~3 hours | Spring Data JPA limitation |
| - | Native SQL sort error | MEDIUM | Integration testing | ~1.5 hours | Column name conversion missing |
| - | Multi-tenant test flakiness | LOW | CI | ~2 hours | Inconsistent tenant IDs in tests |

**Total Bugs:** 4 (last 30 days)
**Average Fix Time:** 2.1 hours
**Escaped to Production:** 0 (caught in dev/testing)

**Target Reduction:** -40% bug escape rate (4 → 2.4 bugs/month)

### 4. Code Review Efficiency

**Review Iterations per PR:**
```
Average: 1.0 (recent maintenance PRs)
Target: 2.0 (more complex features will have iterations)
Goal: Reduce to ≤2.0 with two-stage review
```

**Review Time:**
```
Estimated: 20-30 min per PR (simple tasks)
Complex PRs: 45-60 min (estimated)
Target with Two-Stage: 40-50 min (15-20 min Stage 1 + 20-30 min Stage 2)
```

### 5. Planning Accuracy

**Estimated vs Actual Time (Recent Tasks):**

| Task | Estimated | Actual | Variance |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|
| CI Fixes (PR 71-72) | 1.5 hours total | 3 hours total | +100% |
| README Updates (PR 73) | 30 min | 1 hour | +100% |
| File Reorganization (PR 74) | 45 min | 1 hour | +33% |

**Baseline Accuracy:** ~60% (actual is 1.67x estimated)
**Target Accuracy:** 80% (actual is 1.25x estimated or better)

## Measurement Methodology

### 1. PR Merge Time
- **Source:** GitHub API, git log
- **Formula:** `merge_time - created_time`
- **Frequency:** Weekly (aggregate all PRs from week)

### 2. Test Coverage
- **Source:** JaCoCo reports (backend), Jest/Istanbul (frontend)
- **Formula:** `(covered_lines / total_lines) * 100`
- **Frequency:** Weekly (run after all PRs merged)

### 3. Bug Escape Rate
- **Source:** GitHub Issues with label `bug`
- **Formula:** Count issues created in period
- **Frequency:** Monthly (rolling 30-day window)

### 4. Code Review Iterations
- **Source:** GitHub PR comments, commits after initial review
- **Formula:** Count commits after first review request
- **Frequency:** Per PR (aggregate weekly)

### 5. Planning Accuracy
- **Source:** PR descriptions (estimated time) vs git log (actual time)
- **Formula:** `(estimated_time / actual_time) * 100`
- **Frequency:** Per PR (aggregate weekly)

## Data Collection Scripts

### Automated Metrics Collection (TODO Week 2)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/collect-metrics.sh

# 1. PR Merge Time (last 7 days)
gh pr list --state merged --limit 100 --json number,title,createdAt,mergedAt \
  | jq '.[] | select(.mergedAt > (now - 604800)) | {
      number, title,
      duration: (((.mergedAt | fromdate) - (.createdAt | fromdate)) / 3600)
    }'

# 2. Test Coverage
cd kiteclass/kiteclass-core && ./mvnw clean test jacoco:report
cd kiteclass/kiteclass-gateway && ./mvnw clean test jacoco:report
cd kiteclass-frontend && pnpm test:coverage

# 3. Bug Count (last 30 days)
gh issue list --label bug --state all --json number,title,createdAt,closedAt \
  | jq '.[] | select(.createdAt > (now - 2592000))'

# 4. Review Iterations
gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json commits,reviews \
  | jq '.reviews | length'
```

## Notes

- **Baseline Quality:** Recent PRs (71-74) were simple maintenance tasks with minimal complexity
- **Need Better Baseline:** Should track 10 feature PRs (not just chores) for accurate comparison
- **Frontend Testing:** Not yet established - Week 1-2 will set up frontend test infrastructure
- **Bug Tracking:** Currently tracked manually in MEMORY.md and git commits, should migrate to GitHub Issues
